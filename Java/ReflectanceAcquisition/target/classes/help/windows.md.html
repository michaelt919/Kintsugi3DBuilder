User Interface and Window Guide
===============================

This page describes all the windows and pieces of the user interface and how they work.  You can learn
about menu options, controlling the model and changing the settings for the renderer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
Main Model Window<a name="renderer"</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once a model is loaded, you can interact with the object as you would with most objects in other 3d programs.
This is often referred to as a 'trackball' controller
        
### Controls
* Click and drag to rotate around the object's center
* Use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom in and out
        
Settings Window<a name="settings"></a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Menus
The settings window has two menus that are used to load models and access this help document.

* Models can be loaded from the `File` menu
	- Select `Load a Single Model` to load just one object
	- You can load as many models as you like by selecting this more than once
	- You can also load a `sequence` of related models (a feature that will be expanded in the future)
* The `help` menu gives you access to this document.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Model Loading Settings

The Loading options (see Figure 1) are applied prior to loading a model.  If you change these options you
must reload the model to see any difference.

   **********************************************
   
* __Compress Images__ - Apply texture compression to the images as they are being loaded.  This will reduce
	memory usage significantly but may result in some visual artifacts.
	
* __Use Mipmaps__ - Generate mipmap levels for every view.  This increases memory usage but may help
	eliminate some visual artifacts that are the result of image resampling.
	
* __Generate Depth Maps__ - If the model has some parts that could cast a shadow on itself or otherwise
	obstruct the surface than the depth maps will help it render properly.  If the model does not have these
	features you may safely uncheck this box and reduce memory usage.
	
* __Dimensions__ - The resolution of the depth images.  Only applied if the `generate depth images` option is
	enabled.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Current Model Settings

   **********************************************
   *   .------------------.                     *
   *   |   Current Model   \                    *
   *   +--------------------+----------------.  *
   *   |  .---------------------------+---.  |  *
   *   |  | My Model.xml              | v |  |  *
   *   |  '---------------------------+---'  |  *
   *   |      .                              |  *
   *   |  ----|----------------------------  |  *
   *   |      '                              |  *
   *   '-------------------------------------'  *
   *                                            *
   *--------------------------------------------*
   * Figure 2: Current Model Settings           *                                                          
   **********************************************

The model options (see Figure 2) let you switch between multiple models if more than one is loaded or move
through a sequence of models when the currently selected model is a sequence.  It also lets you visualize all
of the view cameras around the model as small squares.

* __Model Box__ - The first drop down box lets you select the currently active model if more than one has
	been loaded.

* __Model Slider__ - The slider is used to move through the stages of a model sequence. This will only be
	enabled if there are stages to move through.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Performance and Visual Settings
These settings (see Figure 3) allow you to control various aspects of visual quality.  Changing these may
help improve the performance of the renderer but usually come at the expense of lower visual quality.  They
will not help reduce memory usage (see `Model Loading Options` above).

   ***********************************************
   *   .--------------------------------.        *
   *   | Performance and Visual Settings \       *
   *   +----------------------------------+---.  *
   *   |                                      |  *
   *   |  X Half-Resolution  X Multisampling  |  *
   *   |                                .---. |  *
   *   |  X k-nearest mode - k-samples: | 5 | |  *
   *   |                                '---' |  *
   *   |  ----------------------------------  |  *
   *   |  X Show View Cameras                 |  *
   *   |                    .-----.           |  *
   *   |  Background Color: | ... |           |  *
   *   |                    '-----'           |  *
   *   '--------------------------------------'  *
   *                                             *
   *---------------------------------------------*
   * Figure 3: Performance and Visual Settings   *                                                          
   ***********************************************
   
* __Half-Resolution__ - Cut the number of pixels generated in half to help speed up rendering.  This is meant
	to help with High-DPI displays and should be enabled if you have a retina display.  The system will
	attempt to detect this on OS X and enable it automatically.

* __Multisampling__ - Disable OpenGL multisampling.  This will also help speed up rendering but causes some
	jagged lines to appear at the edge of the model.

* __k-nearest mode__ - Blend only the 'k' nearest neighbors of highest weight as in the original Beuhler
	algorithm.  This may help speed up rendering.

* __k-samples__ - Set the 'k' value used by the Beuhler algorithm. Lower is faster but the value cannot be
	less than 2.

* __Show View Cameras__ - Visualize the location and orientation of the cameras.  Handy for double-checking
	that the view information was loaded properly.

* __Background Color__ - Change the color of the background in the main window.  It defaults to a 30% grey
	value.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Advanced Rendering Settings
The weighting equation used by the ULF Renderer does have some user controlable options (see Figre 4).  While
these should generally not need to be adjusted we make them available for those that want to experiment.

   **********************************************
   *   .----------------------------.           *
   *   | Advanced Rendering Options  \          *
   *   +------------------------------+------.  *
   *   |                   .-----.           |  *
   *   |            Gamma: | 2.2 |           |  *
   *   |                   '-----'           |  *
   *   |                                     |  *
   *   |                   .-----.           |  *
   *   |  Weight Exponent: |  16 |           |  *
   *   |                   '-----'           |  *
   *   |  ---------------------------------  |  *
   *   |                           .-------. |  *
   *   |  X Visibility Test - Bias:| 0.002 | |  *
   *   |                           '-------' |  *
   *   '-------------------------------------'  *
   *                                            *
   *--------------------------------------------*
   * Figure 4: Advanced Rendering Settings      *                                                          
   **********************************************
   
* __Gamma__ - Correction applied for non-linear image response curves (based on a standard gamma function).

* __Weight Exponent__ - The 'alpha' value from the weight equation.  Increasing this causes more views to be
	used at each point but will introduce blurryness.  Decreasing it will force the views to have a zero
	effect sooner and results in sharper images.
	
* __Visibility Testing__ - Enable this option to eliminate views bleeding through onto parts of the geometry
	that they could not see. Depth images are required for this to work.
	
* __Bias__ - Minimum value for detecting a difference between the depth in the depth image and the value in
	the current view.  Make this small to help get less bleeding across visibility discontinunities.
	Increase it to eliminate more bleeding.

   **********************************************

This is a special mode that allows you to resample all the views of a model so that they match some other set
of views. You must have the target views ready in a .vset file.  Presently, it is intended for internal use.

* __Dimensions__ - Specify the resolution of the resampled images.

* __Resample__ - Start resampling. You will be prompted for a target vset file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Reporting Bugs

At any time you can click the 'report bug' button to send a manual bug report.  This will take a screenshot
and then generate and upload a 'crash report'.  Note that you should be sure to describe the issue in detail
as the crash report will not be very helpful otherwise.
