Technical Guide
===============

The following page contains some technical details to help you get the best performance out of the ULF
Renderer.  It also has some troubleshooting tips to work around known problems or solve bad configurations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The renderer requires significant processing power particularly from your graphics card and you may find it
runs slow without sufficient hardware.  Be sure to check the web site for a discussion of which GPUs work
well and what settings are recommended.  If you do not meet the minimum requirements you may not be able to
render a model at interactive rates but there are some things youy can do to speed up the renderer

#### Reductions to the model ####

   - __Reduce the resolution of your views__: All of the views must fit in video memory simultaneously. The
	 renderer will attempt to recognize when you run out of memory and warn you but this does not always
	 work and the program may simply crash.  If you think you might be out of memory, try reducing the
	 resolution of the view images (even as low as 1024x1024 still produces very pleasing results).  Also,
	 be sure to enable view compression and try turning off depth images and mipmaps
		
   - __Reduce the number of views__: If you are still running out of memory, there may simple be too many
	 views in the model.  You can open the model back up in PhotoScan and disable views in there.  Then
	 be sure to remove any transformation on the chunk and re-export the cameras.  You can also edit the
	 XML file directly and change 'enabled' to 'false' for any view you wish to leave out.
		
   - __Reduce the number of faces in your model__: While the renderer is generally pixel bound and not
	 geometry/vertex bound, it may still prove useful to reduce the faces from the default model
	 generated by PhotoScan.  We find that models with 100k to 200k faces are quite sufficient when
	 using the renderer.

   - __Zoom out__: The fewer pixels you are trying to render at once the faster it will be so zoom out and
		make the model smaller to increase performance.

#### Renderer Settings ####

   - Try out the 'k-nearest neighbors' mode with a smaller k value to see if performance improves.  This
	 will only find the k best views for each pixel rather sorting them all.
		
   - Try enabling half-resolution mode to cut the number of pixels in half in both dimensions.  While this
	 option is intended for high-DPI displays it always has a dramatic effect on rendering speed.
        
Troubleshooting<a name="troubleshooting"></a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here are some known problems and ways to work around them.  If you think you have a new problems that is not
listed here please re-produce it and then send in a manual bug report.
        
#### _The model is very slow to respond and rotate_ ####
This usually means your system is not powerful enough to render the model.  Check out the 'renderer
settings' tips above and the 'model reduction' tips.

#### _The program crashes while loading a model_ ####
There are several possible causes of this issue and examination of the crash report can help.  Contact the
developer for feedback to help troubleshoot.

Some common problems to check:

   * View image files are corrupted or not supported. Only, PNG, TIFF, and JPEG work and TIFF sometimes
	 fails due to a bug in the image loading library.
		
   * Too much memory was requested from the video card.  See Model reduction tips above.

#### _Progress of loading a model is not shown_ ####
This is a known issue that is caused by Qt Jambi and happens unpredictably on some systems.  We are aware
of it and will try to work with Qt Jambi to resolve the issue in a future release.

#### _Some views have a strange color tint (especially the default, straight on view)_ ####
This problem has been observed on older Mac hardware (non retina display MacBook Pros).  If you are
experiencing this please submit a manual bug report so we can associate it with your particular hardware
as well.
