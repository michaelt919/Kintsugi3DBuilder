        <h1>Performance</h1>
        <p>The renderer requires significant processing power particularly from your graphics card and you may find it runs slow without sufficient hardware.  Be sure to check the web site for a discussion of which GPUs work well and what settings are recommended.  If you do not meet the minimum requirements you may not be able to render a model at interactive rates but there are some things youy can do to speed up the renderer</p>
        
            <ul>
                <li>Reductions to the model</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduce the resolution of your views - All of the views must fit in video memory simultaneously.  The renderer will attempt to recognize when you run out of memory and warn you but this does not always work and the program may simply crash.  If you think you might be out of memory, try reducing the resolution of the view images (even as low as 1024x1024 still procues very pleasing results).  Also, be sure to enable view compression and try turning off depth images and mipmaps</li>
                    <li>Reduce the number of views - If you are still running out of memory, there may simple be too many views in the model.  You can open the model back up in PhotoScan and disable views in there.  Then be sure to remove any transformation on the chunk and re-export the cameras.  You can also edit the XML file directly and change 'enabled' to 'false' for any view you wish to leave out.</li>
                    <li>Reduce the number of faces in your model - While the renderer is generally pixel bound and not geometry/vertex bound, it may still prove useful to reduce the faces from the defult model generated by photoscan.  We find that models with 100k to 200k faces are quite sufficient when using the renderer.</li>
                    <li>Zoom out - The fiewer pixel you are trying to render at once the faster it will be so zoom out and make the model smaller to increase performance.</li>
                </ul><br/>
                <li>Renderer Settings</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Try out 'k-nearest neighbors mode' with a smaller k value to see if performance improves.  This will only find the k best views for each pixel rather than sort them all</li>
                    <li>Try enabling half-resolution mode to cut the number of pixels in 1 quarter.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        
        <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
        <p>Here are some known problems and ways to work around them.  If you think you have a new problems that is not listed here please re-produce it and then send in a manual bug report</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>The model is very slow to respond and rotate.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This usually means your system is not powerful enough to render the model.  Check out the 'renderer settings' above and the 'model reduction' tips.</li>
            </ul><br/>
            <li>The program crashes while loading a model.
                <ul>
                <li>There are several possible causes of this issue and examination of the crash report can help.  Contact the developer for feedback to help troubleshoot.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some common problems to check:</li>
                        <li>View image files are corrupted or not supported.  Only, PNG, TIFF, and JPEG work and TIFF sometimes fails due to a bug in the image loading library.</li>
                        <li>Too much memory was requested from the video card.  See Model reduction tips above.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul><br/>
            <li>Progress of loading a model is not shown.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This is a known issue that will be fixed in a new version linked to Qt Jambi and happens unpredictibly on some systems.</li>
            </ul><br/>
            <li>Some views have a strange color tint (especially the default, straight on view).</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>This problem has been observed on older Mac hardware (non retina display MacBook Pros).  If you are experiencing this please submit a manual bug report so we can associate it with your particular hardware as well.</li>
                </ul>
