/**
 * An interface for any OpenGL-like graphics context.
 * An implementation of this interface serves several purposes:
 * (1) it provides query functions for obtaining information about the GL state, and
 * (2) it serves as an access point for modifying global GL options like depth testing, multisampling, and back-face culling,
 * (3) it provides synchronization functions like flush(), finish(), and swapBuffers(),
 * (4) it acts as a factory for creating GL objects such as buffers, textures, and shaders.
 * @author Michael Tetzlaff
 *
 * @param <ContextType> For concrete types, this type parameter should match the implementing class itself.
 * Abstract implementations should be parameterized so that subclasses can fulfill this constraint.
 * This type parameter ensures that all the objects created by this context are mutually compatible with each other and the context itself.
