    /**
     * Constructs a "library" of smoothstep basis functions.
     * The actual smoothstep function can be customized.
     * The library will consist of a set of smoothsteps that evaluate to:
     *   1.0 when the parameter is 0,
     *   0.0 when the parameter is at the end of the optimized domain.
     *   some value between 0.0 and 1.0 when the parameter is within the optimzed domain.
     * Each smoothstep function in the library will start and end at a different location.
     * The endpoints will be spaced out evenly across the domain.
     * The starting point will generally be a fixed distance from the endpoint, but may be compressed when the
     * endpoint is close to 0.
     * @param resolution The number of discrete elements in the domain of the function to be optimized,
     *                   which determines the number of functions in the library.
     *                   An exception will be thrown if this number is less than 1.
     * @param metallicity The assumed "metallicity" of the function being optimized.
     *                    This value will be clamped between 0 and 1.
     * @param transitionRange The distance between the start and end of each smoothstep function in the library.
     *                        Each smoothstep function will end (with a value of 0.0) at a different location
     *                        (spaced evenly across the domain) and will start (with a value of 1.0) at
     *                        endpoint - transitionRange.  If that difference comes out to be negative, the starting
     *                        point will be clamped to zero.  The effect of this is that some basis functions with a
     *                        smaller transition range will be included in the library.  This is helpful when optimizing
     *                        a BRDF, for instance, which may have a steeper gradient close to the specular peak.
     *                        A transition range of 1 would correspond to a hard step function.
     *                        The transition range will be clamped to 1 if set lower than 1.
     * @param smoothstep The actual smoothstep function to be used.  This function should have accept a domain between
     *                   0.0 and 1.0 and map the values to a range that is also between 0.0 and 1.0, where an input of
     *                   0.0 evaluates to a result of 0.0, and an input of 1.0 evaluates to a result of 1.0.
     *                   It is intended for this function to be monotonically increasing.
     *                   Note that this function will effectively be flipped in practice since the basis functions are
     *                   assumed to evaluate to 1.0 for an input parameter of 0 and decresse down to 1.0 as that
     *                   parameter increases.
