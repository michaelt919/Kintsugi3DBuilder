/**
 * When working with image-based data, it is common to need to solve multiple least squares systems in parallel.
 * For example, when solving for certain kinds of texture maps, each pixel of the texture map may be its own least squares system.
 * This class is an abstraction of all the information that needs to be known about the model that is being fit to
 * in order to use the generic LeastSquaresMatrixBuilder class.
 * @param <S> The type of the data bundles coming from the graphics stream.
 *            Each bundle should contain no more than one valid sample for each system to be solved.
 *            For instance, this is typically the case when each bundle comes from a single view and each system is a unique position on a 3D surface.
 * @param <T> The type of a sample (ground truth data) after being processed and the evaluated basis functions.
 *            This type may be a multi-dimensional entity; for instance, a color with red, green, and blue components.
 *            When a sample is a multi-dimensional entity, it is assumed that a single solution will apply to all components.
 *            Alternatively, if it is desired for each dimension to be solved for separately, each one should be its own system
 *            and the definition of a "system index" can be redefined accordingly.
