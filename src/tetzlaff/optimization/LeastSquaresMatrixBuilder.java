/**
 * When working with image-based data, it is common to need to solve multiple least squares systems in parallel.
 * For example, when solving for certain kinds of texture maps, each pixel of the texture map may be its own least squares system.
 * This class contains a generic implementation of this kind of system.
 * It is set up to support taking input from a generic graphics stream
 * (typically data obtained from a sequence of GPU draw calls into an offscreen framebuffer),
 * and interprets that data as a set of samples that span all of the systems that need to be solved.
 * These samples are used to build the matrices for the actual systems that need to be solved to obtain a least squares solution.
